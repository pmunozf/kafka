DONE tool should check that a zookeeper is running?
     since they are threaded, they die when the manager dies
     so there cannot be any old service running from a 
     previous run unless manually deployed.
add get info commands about running instances
create a client class (just as the server manager) ¿¿O el mismo objeto manager que pueda comportarse tanto como cliente como servidor segun la funcion??
move client and server classes to lib
add hooks for to instance commands to log everyeverwhere
